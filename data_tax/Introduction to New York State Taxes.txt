New York State imposes several types of taxes, including income tax, sales tax, and property tax. Understanding these different taxes is important for residents and businesses. Unlike federal taxes, which are collected nationwide, state taxes are specific to New York's own budgetary needs and services.

Income tax is levied on residents and part-year residents who earn income in the state. New York's income tax rates range from 4% to over 10%, depending on the taxpayer's income bracket. The state also charges a sales tax on most goods and services, currently at a base rate of 4%, although local counties may add additional percentages.

Property tax is another key aspect, which is levied on real estate owners based on the value of their property. Property taxes fund public schools, infrastructure, and other local services. It is vital to understand these taxes to stay compliant and take advantage of potential deductions or credits.

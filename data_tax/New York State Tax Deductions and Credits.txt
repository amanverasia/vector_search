New York State provides a range of tax deductions and credits designed to reduce the overall tax burden for residents. These incentives can significantly impact the amount of tax owed or increase the refund you receive.

Some common deductions include those for mortgage interest, property taxes, and charitable contributions. Additionally, New York offers credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which helps low- to moderate-income working individuals and families, and the Child and Dependent Care Credit, which supports parents with childcare expenses.

Itâ€™s important to be aware of these opportunities to minimize tax liability. Tax software or a qualified tax preparer can help identify eligible deductions and credits, ensuring you receive the maximum benefit allowed under New York State tax law.

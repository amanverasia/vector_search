Filing income tax returns in New York State is a process that must be completed annually by residents, part-year residents, and non-residents who earn income within the state. Generally, the tax filing deadline is April 15th, but if it falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline may be extended.

Individuals need to use forms like IT-201 (for full-year residents) or IT-203 (for part-year residents or non-residents) to report income, deductions, and tax liabilities. Itâ€™s important to ensure all sources of income are reported accurately to avoid penalties.

If you are unable to meet the tax deadline, New York State offers the option to apply for a six-month extension, which can be done using Form IT-370. However, it's crucial to note that this extension only grants more time to file, not to pay any taxes due.

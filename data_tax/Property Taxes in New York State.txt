Property tax in New York State is an important source of revenue for local governments, helping fund services like education, emergency services, and public infrastructure. Property taxes are levied based on the assessed value of a property, which is determined by local assessors.

Homeowners receive an annual property tax bill, which is calculated by multiplying the property's assessed value by the tax rate set by the municipality. Itâ€™s crucial for property owners to review their assessments to ensure they are fair, as incorrect assessments can lead to overpayment.

If you believe your property assessment is incorrect, you have the right to file an appeal. Additionally, New York State offers property tax exemptions, such as the STAR (School Tax Relief) program, which helps reduce the property tax burden for eligible homeowners.

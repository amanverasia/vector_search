If you are unable to file your New York State tax return by the standard deadline of April 15th, you can apply for an extension. An extension grants you additional time to submit your tax return but does not extend the time to pay any taxes owed.

To file for an extension, use Form IT-370. The extension typically grants an additional six months, moving the deadline to mid-October. However, any tax that is due should still be paid by the original April deadline to avoid interest and penalties.

It is important to file for an extension even if you cannot pay the full amount owed. Doing so will help you avoid the late filing penalty, which can be much more severe than the penalty for late payment.

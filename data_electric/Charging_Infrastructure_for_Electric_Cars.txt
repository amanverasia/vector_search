A key factor in the success of electric vehicles is the availability of charging infrastructure. Public charging stations are becoming more common, but there is still a need for a more widespread network, especially in rural and suburban areas. Charging stations are categorized into three levels: Level 1 (120V), Level 2 (240V), and DC fast charging. Level 1 charging is the slowest, taking several hours for a full charge, while DC fast charging can provide an 80% charge in under an hour. Governments and private companies are investing in expanding the charging network to support the growing number of electric vehicles on the road.

The heart of an electric car is its battery, and battery technology is one of the most critical factors in the development of electric vehicles. Most modern electric cars use lithium-ion batteries, which offer a high energy density and a long lifespan. However, battery performance can be affected by temperature, charging habits, and age. Research is ongoing to develop new types of batteries, such as solid-state batteries, which could offer even greater energy efficiency, faster charging times, and improved safety. Battery recycling is another important issue as the demand for electric vehicles increases.

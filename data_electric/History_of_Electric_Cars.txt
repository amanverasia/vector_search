The history of electric cars dates back to the 19th century. Electric vehicles (EVs) were among the first automobiles to be invented, even before the internal combustion engine gained prominence. Early electric cars were popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s, but eventually lost out to gasoline-powered vehicles due to their longer range and lower cost. Today, electric cars are making a resurgence due to advances in battery technology and a growing awareness of environmental issues.

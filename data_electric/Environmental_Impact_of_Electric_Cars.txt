Electric cars are often seen as a greener alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, but their environmental impact is more complex. While electric vehicles produce zero emissions at the tailpipe, the production and disposal of batteries can have significant environmental consequences. Mining for lithium, cobalt, and other materials used in batteries can harm ecosystems and require significant energy. However, electric vehicles are still more environmentally friendly over their lifetime compared to gasoline cars, especially if powered by renewable energy. Efforts to improve battery recycling and reduce the environmental footprint of electric vehicle manufacturing are ongoing.

Electric cars work by using an electric motor powered by electricity from batteries or a fuel cell. Unlike traditional gasoline vehicles, electric cars do not have an internal combustion engine. Instead, they rely on electric energy stored in rechargeable batteries, which power the motor to turn the wheels. The batteries are charged by plugging into an electrical outlet or a charging station. Regenerative braking is another feature that helps extend the range of electric vehicles by converting some of the kinetic energy lost during braking back into electrical energy.

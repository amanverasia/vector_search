While both electric cars and hybrid cars aim to reduce emissions, they function differently. Electric cars run solely on electricity and need to be recharged through an external power source, whereas hybrid cars combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor. Hybrids can switch between using gasoline and electricity, and some even allow short electric-only trips. Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) offer a middle ground, with a larger battery that can be charged externally but also rely on gasoline for extended range. Full electric vehicles (EVs) have no tailpipe emissions, while hybrids still produce some emissions when running on gasoline.

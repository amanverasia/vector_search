Article 7: Non-Resident and Part-Year Resident Tax Requirements

Non-residents and part-year residents who earn income in New York are also subject to New York State income taxes. The state requires individuals who have worked in New York or have other sources of income within the state to file using Form IT-203.

Part-year residents must report all income earned while living in New York, as well as any income derived from New York sources during their non-residency period. Non-residents, meanwhile, only report income earned within the state.

It’s crucial to correctly allocate income between New York and other states if you have multiple residences or income sources. This ensures accurate taxation and avoids double taxation. Professional guidance may be helpful if your residency situation is complex.

Article 8: Understanding Use Tax in New York State

Use tax is a counterpart to sales tax and applies to items purchased outside of New York State but used within the state. If you buy goods online, by mail, or in another state without paying New York sales tax, you are required to report and pay use tax on those items.

The use tax rate is the same as the sales tax rate in your locality. This tax ensures that out-of-state purchases do not unfairly disadvantage in-state businesses. Common items subject to use tax include furniture, electronics, and other tangible goods.

You can report and pay use tax on your state income tax return, usually on Form IT-201. Keeping records of all untaxed purchases made throughout the year is important for accurate use tax reporting.

Article 9: New York State Tax Penalties and Interest

Failing to file or pay New York State taxes on time can result in penalties and interest. The most common penalties include a late filing penalty, a late payment penalty, and interest on unpaid taxes.

The late filing penalty is usually 5% of the tax due for each month (or part of a month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. The late payment penalty is generally 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month it remains unpaid, also up to a maximum of 25%.

Interest accrues on any unpaid tax from the original due date until the tax is paid in full. It’s important to pay as much as possible by the filing deadline to reduce interest charges. If you are facing financial hardship, New York State may offer installment agreements to help manage payments.

Article 10: How to Contact the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance
